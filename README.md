### Welcome to Data Warehouse Project

- The main ageda of the project is to find the insights and usage of the stackoverflow among the users by ingesting the emerging technologies such as Snowflake, DBT Cloud and PowerBI.



### Project Overview:

The objective of this Data Transformation initiative is to utilize Snowflake and dbt Cloud for enhancing and refining key business operations using Stack Overflow's live data and vast dataset. Focusing on three core domains—Quality of Posts, Interactions with Posts, and User Involvement—the project is dedicated to converting unprocessed data into meaningful, actionable insights. To facilitate this, a range of BI dashboards will be created to present the data dynamically and informatively, thereby supporting stakeholders in making decisions based on solid data.

### Project Phases:

### Data Profiling and Business Processes Identification:  

-After data profiling and analyzing Stack Overflow's data we come up with 3 business processes to describe about the data
  
- **Post Quality:** Utilizing our "Vote Types, View Counts" dashboard, we'll track post quality metrics across different formats.
- **Post Interactions:** Our "Post Interactio s" dashboard will allow us to monitor the engagements of various posts, focusing on comments, types of comments, their score and engagement levels.
- **User Engagement:** The "User Engagement" dashboard will enable us to scrutinize user activity, reputation scores, and badge distributions to understand user involvement more deeply.
  
### Implementation of Business Processes:
- Utilized the detailed dimensional models to build dbt models that mirror
the business matrix structure, ensuring the data is organized for efficient querying and analysis.
- Constructed SQL and YAML files for dimension and fact tables, enabling the creation of star schemas in Snowflake with comprehensive documentation via dbt Cloud.

### Business Intelligence Visualization:

- Developed Power BI dashboards to visualize transformed data, facilitating an interactive and intuitive experience for stakeholders.
- Dashboards such as "User Engagement", "Post Quality", "Post Interactions", and "Views and Interactions by Location" provide diverse perspectives on the data, from user activity to post performance.

### Expected Deliverables:

- A suite of BI dashboards reflecting key business metrics, enabling stakeholders to explore data through interactive visualizations.
- A Snowflake data warehouse, structured according to the business matrix, optimized for analysis and reporting.
- Comprehensive documentation of the dbt models and their relation to the BI dashboards.
